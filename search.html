                <h3> Meditation Balances the Body's Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    With meditation, we can benefit our overall health by training in letting go of negative thoughts and encouraging more positive thinking. This will decrease stress and anxiety and give us a clearer mind. A clear mind leads to more discernment so that we make fewer mistakes and better decisions. With better decision-making, we have fewer regrets, and this positively impacts our overall well-being.

                    <h3>BENEFITS OF RUNNING IN THE MORNING </h3>
                    <p>
                        This one is quite obvious, but is worth emphasizing – running (whether morning, afternoon, or evening!) can significantly improve your fitness. Running helps to build cardiovascular endurance. Every time you pound the pavement, your heart has to beat faster and work harder to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body.In addition, running helps you maintain healthy cholesterol levels and regulates blood pressure. Ample research has shown that recreational runners have better heart health compared to their sedentary counterparts.  (And you don’t need a ton to make a difference – studies suggest even low levels of running have this effect).Of course, these benefits can occur with other forms of cardiovascular exercise too – but running is inexpensive and feasible for anyone to start doing.

                        <h3> Healthy Eating</h3>
                        <p>
                            A healthy diet may help to prevent certain long-term (chronic) diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. It may also help to reduce your risk of developing some cancers and help you to keep a healthy weight. This leaflet explains the principles of a healthy diet. It is general advice for most people. The advice may be different for certain groups of people, including pregnant women, people with certain health problems or those with special dietary requirements.
